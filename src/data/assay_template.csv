HepG2 cells were cultured in DMEM media supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum and 0.2% (v/v) of a penicillin/streptomycin solution. Antibiotics were added to the medium to eliminate potential interference from microbial contamination that may be present on the test material and control samples. Cells were cultured at 37 °C and 5% CO2; complete medium was changed every 2 to 3 days. HepG2 cells (150,000 cells/well) were seeded in black view 96-well plates and exposed to the toxic agents for 72 h. A volume of 0.2 mL per well of diluted test compound in DMEM with FBS and penicillin/streptomycin was added to HepG2 cells cultured overnight in a 96-well plate (0 - 1 mM, final concentration of compound). In untreated cells, only complete medium was added.  Following incubation with the compound, cells were washed twice with PBS.

All reactions were run in and the 1× assay buffer (20 mM HEPES [pH 7.4], 0.1% CHAPS, 5 mM DTT, and 2 mM EDTA). 50 µL of the 1× lysis buffer (50 mM HEPES [pH 7.4], 5 mM CHAPS, and 5 mM DTT) was added to the cells, and plates were incubated for 20 min at 4 °C in the orbital shaker at 350 rpm. To this, 150 µL of the reaction mixture (from 3 mL of the 1× reaction buffer and 5 µL of the Ac-DEVD-AMC substrate (10 mM in DMSO) was added, and plates were further incubated for 1 h in the dark. Fluorescence was measured at excitation 360 nm and emission 460 nm in the Gemini fluorometer every 10 minutes for 40-60 minutes (slit width 5 nm). For the positive controls, lyophilized caspase-3 was reconstituted in water to a concentration of 100 µg/mL; before use, it was diluted 1:200 in the 1× cell lysis buffer.

Cell survival fractions were calculated as percentage of the untreated control. The experimental data were fitted to sigmoidal concentration-response curves and the corresponding IC50 values (concentrations causing 50% reduction of cellular survival vs. the untreated control) via non-linear regression (GraphPad Prizm software for PC).,,1,,72-h P. falciparum Dd2- SybrGreen viability assay,A00154,,cell_death,malaria,,,,,24,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,,Acinetobacter (1536w) 24h BTG Viability Assay,A00187,,cell_death,"bacteria --> UTIs, etc.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3,,Crypto-C. parvum HCI proliferation assay - Bunch Grass Farm,A00208,,parasite growth,parasite --> diarrhea,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3,,Crypto-C. parvum HCI proliferation assay - Sterling Lab,A00093,,parasite growth,parasite --> diarrhea,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4,,Crypto-HCT-8 Host Cells - Bunch Grass Farm C. parvum,A00210,,co-infection human + parasite,parasite --> diarrhea,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4,,Crypto-HCT-8 Host Cells - Sterling Lab C. parvum,A00209,,co-infection human + parasite,parasite --> diarrhea,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,5,,HEK293T 72-h cytotoxicity assay,A00086,,cell_death,large number T-cells,,,,,72,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,5,,HEK293T 72-h cytotoxicity assay,A00145,,cell_death,large number T-cells,,,,,72,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,5,,HEK293T 72-h cytotoxicity assay,A00148,,cell_death,large number T-cells,,,,,72,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,6,,HepG2 72-h cytotoxicity assay,A00087,,cell_death,cancer,,,,,72,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,6,,HepG2 72-h cytotoxicity assay,A00215,,cell_death,cancer,,,,,72,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,6,,HepG2 72-h cytotoxicity assay,A00219,,cell_death,cancer,,,,,72,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,7,,TB aaRS inhibitor screen,A00179,,inhibitor_screen,TB inhibitors of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,7,,TBaaRS Rhodamine/Malachite inhibitor screen,A00206,,inhibitor_screen,TB inhibitors of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,8,,Wolbachia HCI assay (1536w),A00144,,cell_death,bacteria which infects insects --> bad human illnesses,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
