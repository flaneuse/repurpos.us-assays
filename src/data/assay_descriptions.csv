HepG2 cells were cultured in DMEM media supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum and 0.2% (v/v) of a penicillin/streptomycin solution. Antibiotics were added to the medium to eliminate potential interference from microbial contamination that may be present on the test material and control samples. Cells were cultured at 37 °C and 5% CO2; complete medium was changed every 2 to 3 days. HepG2 cells (150,000 cells/well) were seeded in black view 96-well plates and exposed to the toxic agents for 72 h. A volume of 0.2 mL per well of diluted test compound in DMEM with FBS and penicillin/streptomycin was added to HepG2 cells cultured overnight in a 96-well plate (0 - 1 mM, final concentration of compound). In untreated cells, only complete medium was added.  Following incubation with the compound, cells were washed twice with PBS.

All reactions were run in and the 1× assay buffer (20 mM HEPES [pH 7.4], 0.1% CHAPS, 5 mM DTT, and 2 mM EDTA). 50 µL of the 1× lysis buffer (50 mM HEPES [pH 7.4], 5 mM CHAPS, and 5 mM DTT) was added to the cells, and plates were incubated for 20 min at 4 °C in the orbital shaker at 350 rpm. To this, 150 µL of the reaction mixture (from 3 mL of the 1× reaction buffer and 5 µL of the Ac-DEVD-AMC substrate (10 mM in DMSO) was added, and plates were further incubated for 1 h in the dark. Fluorescence was measured at excitation 360 nm and emission 460 nm in the Gemini fluorometer every 10 minutes for 40-60 minutes (slit width 5 nm). For the positive controls, lyophilized caspase-3 was reconstituted in water to a concentration of 100 µg/mL; before use, it was diluted 1:200 in the 1× cell lysis buffer.
